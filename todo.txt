1. spades K value (if recycler) 
    - TK: Putonti's advice is along the same avenue we're already doing so I think recycler should be a last minute add on if we have time
2. remove trimmomatic 
    - TK: done
3. test plasmid script 
4. double check paths in main.sh
    - TK did this, should be useable now. The paths assume /data is where the input fasta is and /output/Results are where tools write results
5.add output flag
    - TK: there is an output flag in plasmid.py. main.sh will always write to /output as that is what is bind-mounted to the local computer
6.find benchmark data
7.check runtime info (Saturday)
8.comb through fasta output and develop the FINAL csv file.
    - plasforest has a CSV with chromosome vs plasmid indicated
    - platon has chromosome and plasmid fasta files with the same names as in plasforest's CSV
    - plasmidspades has different results. Will run a local blast to match plasmidSPAdes plasmids to the SPAdes contigs
