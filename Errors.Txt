##Need help fixing this


## Tristan - docker folder dockerfile


recycler installation failed. testing out new bioconda installation

Error-Need help figuring out how to get a file from the tools results to outside the container to a users file. However we also need to still store the results from the tools inside the docker as well.

Cannot figure out how to access some of the programs from within the container ie (recycle.py: not found) and (can't open file '//PlasForest.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory)
